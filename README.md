# React Native Baseline

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Process:

   1. Android Phone Started. Required for steps below.
   2. Metro Server Bundler
      > triggers build system to pull packages.
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      --> npx react-native
      ```
   3. Run the app installer.
      > initializes install of the app to the android emulator ( can take a while ).
      ```bash
      - For Android
      --> npx android
      - For IOS
      --> npx ios
      ```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Development

1. Open `src/Main.mjs`.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) for **"Element Inspecting"**.

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!
